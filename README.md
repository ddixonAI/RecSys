# Recommendation System Side Project

The general goal here is to develop a two-tower ANN architecture from scratch in PyTorch. I'll be using an open-sourced dataset. Ancillary goals include proper project organization and version control, and containorization using Docker. I may also experiment with deploying to FastAPI for real-time prediction.
